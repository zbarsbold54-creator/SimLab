# SimLab progress

## Phase 0+1 — deterministic core

Status: Phase 1 gate passed and committed as `Phase 1: verified deterministic core`.

## Phase 1 audit

The initial audit found these real defects and addressed them as follows:

- `python -m simlab.cli --version` was unsupported; the CLI now exposes the package version.
- The world used a grid and global `np.random.seed`; it now uses continuous motion and one `numpy.Generator`.
- Dead agents were removed and state was mirrored in the runner; the World now retains full agent state and owns snapshots.
- `run_episode` referenced a missing registry; it now consumes World state directly.
- Snapshots omitted reliable Generator state; snapshots now carry the complete state and restore exact futures.
- Tests were duplicated under `simlab/tests/` and scratch files were collected; tests now live in root `tests/` with pytest discovery restricted there.

What exists now:

- `World` owns continuous agent, food, hazard, time, and RNG state; it exposes `snapshot`, `restore`, and `state_hash`.
- `Action` uses turn/thrust/eat controls and `StepResult` follows the terminated/truncated/info shape.
- `Runner` seeds one NumPy Generator, records actions and snapshots, and provides headless run and benchmark commands.
- Root `tests/` contains the five Phase 1 gates; pytest is restricted to that directory.
- The GUI and survival hazards, sensing, drives, plugins, and research integrations remain for later phases.

Run:

```text
python -m pytest -q
python -m simlab.cli --version
python -m simlab.cli run --steps 1000 --seed 1
python -m simlab.cli bench --steps 1000
```

Open decisions: none for Phase 1.

## Phase 2 — survival, sensing, drives, plugins

Status: Phase 2 gate passed from `.venv`.

- Hazards chase nearby agents, wander through the seeded generator otherwise, and damage health on contact.
- Observations contain 16 ray distances, type channels for food/hazard/wall/agent, and proprioception.
- `BasicDriveCore` exposes the fixed eight placeholder drives and routes updates through `RetentionRule`.
- `FixedDecay`, `PassthroughRetention`, `HeuristicPolicy`, `RandomPolicy`, task, metric, and example plugin are registry components.
- Registry startup imports every module in `simlab/plugins/` automatically.

Gate output:

```text

random: mean=852.90 spread(std)=804.24 min=277 max=3551
```

The GUI remains for Phase 3; no GUI code was added in this phase.

## Phase 2 verification

Verification from `.venv`:

- `python -m pytest -v`: 17 tests passed, including exact ray distances/types, 2000-step drive bounds, TOML-selected retention behavior, and auto-discovery/selectability of a temporary plugin.
- `python -m simlab.cli bench --steps 1000 --agents 20`: 20 agents, 286.8 steps/s.
- `Snapshot.terrain` was unused and has been removed. `Snapshot.world_state` remains a derived occupancy raster used by `World.get_world_state()` and stored in `.npz` as a display/inspection preview.

Survival diagnosis (`Runner._max_steps = 100000`; cause is starvation if energy reached zero before death, hazard damage otherwise):

```

The heuristic runs consume food but the current finite food supply runs out, after which energy reaches zero and health drains. Random runs do not find food reliably and usually die from chasing hazards before starvation. Neither policy reached the 100000-step limit.

## Phase 3 — GUI shell

Status: GUI shell implemented; Phase 3 gate verified from `.venv`.

- Added a dark Qt window, toolbar, antialiased world renderer with zoom/pan, and a simulation worker hosted in a `QThread`.
- The worker publishes deeply immutable `Snapshot` instances; the GUI timer renders the newest snapshot at no more than 60 FPS.
- Added speed, play/pause, single-step, reset/seed controls and status for step, sim time, render FPS, sim steps/s, and seed.
- `python -m simlab.cli gui` lazily imports the GUI; a subprocess test confirms `import simlab.core` does not load PySide6.
- Added an offscreen `QApplication` worker smoke test and `scripts/render_screenshot.py`.

Gate output:

agents=20 speed=Max render_fps=48.6 sim_steps_per_second=125.0
```

Screenshot: `docs/screenshots/phase3.png`.

## Phase 3 visual fixes

- The speed selector and worker now share `theme.DEFAULT_SPEED`; selecting a speed updates the target rate.
- The default 50x50 arena uses a configured 30-unit hazard detection radius and 1.5-unit contact radius. The old renderer drew the 30-unit detection ring. Detection configuration is unchanged; a smaller 10-unit default was proposed and awaits user direction.
- Arena contents are clipped to the arena. The faint default hazard ring shows contact radius; detection radius appears on hazard hover or when a selected agent is within detection range.
- Food is amount-scaled and desaturated; agents use a solid energy-interpolated fill and render above food and hazards.
- Default GUI agent count is read from `configs/default.toml` (`[agent] count = 5`).
- Toolbar/status spacing, seed label, title, minimum size, arena fill/border, and combo styling were polished.
- Added speed, food-radius, detection-ring, and TOML agent-count tests.

## Phase 3 polish 2

- Agent body length is 1.6 radii (5.28 world units), about 1.55 times the default food diameter (3.4 units). Geometry is generated in local coordinates, then rotated and translated; a pure-function test checks the heading axis and mirrored rear vertices.
- Toolbar and status text insets are verified in an offscreen window: first toolbar widget x=8, status label x=16.
- Seed label background is transparent. The speed selector uses the SVG chevron icon and themed popup list.
- Screenshot script now advances to the requested screenshot step and then prints actual patch sizes at its food diagnostic step.

## Phase 4 — Inspection

- Added selectable agent inspection, follow camera, rays and vision overlays, trails, grid, and a drive-colored halo.
- Added a right-side inspector with live agent state, current action, sensor summary, and eight drive bars; a bottom pyqtgraph history plot and timeline; and a registry-backed scenario dock with presets, sliders, policy and DriveCore selectors.
- Scenario apply resets the worker on its QThread with the selected seed. The worker publishes frozen per-step `SimulationFrame` data; core imports remain independent of Qt.
- Verification: selecting `agent_0` displays inspector data and live drive series; applying a 4-agent, 2-hazard scenario retains seed 29 and applies food regrowth 0.17.

## Phase 5 — Timeline, snapshots, replay

- The worker now retains a bounded ring of per-step snapshots and batches them to the GUI. The timeline can seek to an exact stored step; Play resumes from that checkpoint using the recorded actions, preserving the original future.
- Added JSON+NPZ snapshot save/load controls and an in-memory Record/Replay toolbar. `ActionLog` can also serialize action records as JSON.
- Split worker frame data, component execution, history, and thread controls into focused modules; `simlab/gui/sim_worker.py` is 261 lines.
- Run the studio with `python -m simlab.cli gui`.

## Phase 6 — Polish and docs

- Finished the shared dark Qt styling for checkbox indicators, hover/pressed/checked/disabled/focus states, themed combo popup rows, scrollbars, and tooltips. Existing controls use text labels and the shared chevron asset; layout and palette remain in `simlab/gui/theme.py` and `simlab/gui/style.qss`.
- Added a fresh-checkout README with PowerShell virtual-environment, install, run, test, and lint commands. Added `docs/EXTENDING.md` with short decorator-based drive, policy, and retention examples; noted that retention registry selection is not yet wired into GUI drive construction.
- Added `scripts/phase6_performance.py` to measure a visible 20-agent GUI at 10x and Max.
- Ruff formatting corrected the existing NumPy tutorial file so repository-wide `ruff format --check .` passes.
- Fresh-clone packaging validation exposed setuptools flat-layout discovery of `configs` and `learning`; `pyproject.toml` now limits installed package discovery to `simlab*`.

Offscreen screenshot review: panel and control styling is consistent; this Qt runtime exposes no font families, so its screenshot renders text as missing-glyph boxes. This environment limitation does not establish how text renders in the user's interactive Windows session.

## Verification pass — Phase 5 replay and GUI throughput

- Added root `AGENTS.md` with the workspace boundaries and implementation gates; committed separately as `Add AGENTS.md` (`c1d2044`).
- Confirmed Phase 5 replay coverage: `tests/test_phase5.py::test_scrub_back_500_steps_and_replay_matches_original_future` stores 700 action/result hashes, restores the step-200 checkpoint, replays the final 500 recorded actions, and asserts every resulting hash. `tests/test_hardening.py::test_snapshot_disk_round_trip_replays_future` saves NPZ+JSON, restores a fresh World, checks the starting hash, and checks 200 subsequent hashes.
- Throughput work batches Max stepping, omits per-step observation/snapshot construction, publishes the newest immutable frame for GUI-timer polling, stores timeline checkpoints every 25 steps, batches heuristic food-location preparation, and yields once per 32-step Max batch. Simulation action/state rules are unchanged. Diagnostic and measurement scripts: `scripts/verification_episodes.py` and `scripts/verification_throughput.py`.
- Throughput measurement used 20 agents, all overlays on, `agent_0` selected, 3-second samples (0.5-second Max sample), and p95 timer-frame intervals:

```text
agents=20 overlays=all selected=agent_0 speed=1x render_fps=59.1 sim_steps_per_second=10.0 p95_frame_time_ms=23.43
agents=20 overlays=all selected=agent_0 speed=10x render_fps=58.3 sim_steps_per_second=100.3 p95_frame_time_ms=22.53
agents=20 overlays=all selected=agent_0 speed=Max render_fps=21.7 sim_steps_per_second=1512.3 p95_frame_time_ms=63.36
```

  Before optimization, the same script measured Max at 96.3 steps/s, 0.6 FPS, and 1817.49 ms p95. The uninstrumented final Max sample clears 1500 steps/s; the UI remains less responsive in Max than at capped speeds.
- Instrumented final profile: 1540.7 steps/s, 15.4 FPS, 71.45 ms p95; 135 snapshots cost 25.4 ms total, 67 scheduler yields cost 5.2 ms, worker CPU fraction was 0.810, 441.5 ms was in action generation, 451.5 ms in Runner stepping, and 334.3 ms across 62 paint events. Instrumentation reduces throughput and is not the primary reported rate.
- Episode diagnostics used the default 50x50 configuration, one agent, seeds 1-20, and the 100000-step Runner cap. Raw per-seed rows were printed by `scripts/verification_episodes.py`: heuristic episodes ended by starvation after 3766-4959 steps and ate 79-490 patches; random episodes ended by hazard damage after 423-3081 steps and ate none. No run reached the cap. For comparison on a 100-unit square, detection radius 30 is 30% of the side (60% diameter), and contact radius 1.5 is 1.5% of the side (3% diameter). The configured default arena is 50x50, so those radii are 60% and 3% of its side respectively.
- `python -m simlab.cli bench --agents 20`: final rerun printed `agents=20 steps=1000 steps_per_second=1073.7` (a prior run printed 1119.3).
- Full `.venv` test run: 33 passed. Ruff check and format check both pass. `where.exe python` listed `.venv` first and `sys.prefix` was `C:\AI\SimulationCode\.venv`.
- Real-window inspection could not be completed: the desktop automation inventory exposed no application/native window, including after starting the CLI GUI. The offscreen Qt smoke test passed, but the real interactive rendering has not been visually verified in this session.

## Verification 2 and world tuning sweep

- Added `tests/test_fast_path.py::test_max_batch_matches_headless_hashes_for_1000_steps`. It drives the same `_advance_one_step` helper used by the GUI worker in 32-step Max batches and compares the 20-agent worker and ordinary Runner hashes after every one of 1000 steps. It passed with the Phase 5 replay and disk restore tests (`3 passed in 3.36s`). This also checks the world RNG state because it is included in `state_hash()`.
- Before the bench fast path, an uninstrumented 20-agent run measured 1073 steps/s. cProfile (profiler overhead included) showed 1000 `World.step` calls at 1.437 s cumulative, snapshots at 0.605 s, observations at 0.368 s, ray casts at 0.277 s, and `Runner._default_action` at 0.412 s. The CLI bench does not call registered drives or policy classes; it uses the Runner's built-in heuristic action. `run_bench` now skips unused observations, snapshots, and AgentState views while retaining the same state transitions and action log. After: 2593.4 steps/s in the final uninstrumented run; a cProfile run measured 1000 `World.step` calls at 0.414 s and default action generation at 0.393 s. Sensing, drive, and registered-policy calls are absent from this benchmark path.
- The CLI bench and GUI Max rates measure different workloads. CLI bench now measures headless world stepping and Runner actions without rendering, observations, or per-step snapshots. GUI Max adds policy components, history/action storage, checkpoint snapshots every 25 steps, GUI frame construction and rendering, and a batch yield; its earlier measured rate was 1512.3 steps/s.
- The default arena is set to 50x50 in `configs/default.toml` (and `WorldConfig` in `simlab/core/config.py`). `git log -S 'width = 50' -- configs/default.toml` and `git blame` identify commit `ab3b0b6 Initial project structure: pyproject.toml, README.md, PROGRESS.md, folder layout, core and interfaces stubs` as the commit that introduced the 50-unit dimensions. Added `configs/harsh_original.toml` as an unchanged named copy of the original config; `configs/default.toml` was not modified.
- Energy-budget check, seed 1, one agent: initial energy 100; heuristic thrust 0.8 gives speed 6.4 and drain `(0.08 + 0.04*6.4)*0.1 = 0.0336` energy/step; energy alone lasts about 2976 steps, followed by 200 health-drain steps. There are 20 patches × 20 units = 400 initial food units, but no regrowth. The run consumed 20 units in 87 successful eat ticks, yielding about 20 / 0.0336 = 595 additional energy-equivalent steps and explaining the typical ~3770-step outcomes. `food_eaten` counts successful bite ticks, not whole patches. The 17 ordinary seeds cluster near the same duration because they obtain about one patch's 20 energy units before starvation; a few seeds happen to intersect more food.
- No world food-regrowth mechanic exists: `food.spawn_rate` only determines initial patch count, capped by `food.max_food=20`. Therefore the requested 1x/3x/10x sweep uses the only existing food knob and reports the cap; those factors all produce 20 initial patches. This is not a regrowth experiment, and the script reports that limitation instead of changing world behavior. All 12 cells are below:

- Every five-agent cell had 0% heuristic cap survivors. With finite food and positive drain, indefinite survival is impossible in the current implementation; no parameter recommendation can meet the requested indefinite-survival condition without a real regrowth mechanism. Conditional candidates after a regrowth rate is defined are detection radius 12 or 16; hazard deaths were 10-13% in those cells. A moving heuristic agent needs about 0.0336 energy per step, or 0.168 per step for five agents before accounting for food availability. No default was changed.

## Heuristic and fast-path fixes (tasks 1-6)

### 1. Starvation anomaly (fixed)

Root cause: target selection (both `Runner._default_action` and the old world-state heuristic) picked the nearest FoodPatch even when its `amount` was 0.0, so an agent orbited a depleted patch forever and starved with ~380/400 food still present. Fixed by filtering patches with `amount > 0.0` in `Runner._default_action` and in the sensor heuristic. Before (one agent, seeds 1-5): deaths at 3771-4366 with 20-40 food units eaten. After: seeds 1,2,3,5 eat all 400 units and survive to ~16266; seed 4 dies at 7902 by hazard (158.8 eaten).

### 2. Sensor-based heuristic (done)

`HeuristicPolicy` now uses only `obs` (rays + ray_types + proprioception) via `Policy.act`; it no longer touches World state and no longer implements `select_action`. World-state version preserved as `OracleHeuristicPolicy`, registered as `oracle_heuristic`. Survival report over 10 seeds x 5 agents (defaults, step cap 50000):
- sensor heuristic: median 6421, spread 4504-7567, all hazard deaths
- oracle heuristic: median 4100, spread 3472-5554
- random: median 4270, spread 3562-4346

### 3. Fast-path correctness (done)

Added `needs_observations` to the `Policy` and `DriveCore` protocols (default True); `pipeline.needs_observations()` computes the combined flag. `tests/test_fast_path_plugins.py` registers a recurrent `RecurrentTestDriveCore` (FixedDecay retention) and a `StatefulTestPolicy` that reads obs + drive_state and keeps internal state; it asserts GUI Max path (`_advance_one_step`) and headless Runner give identical per-step world hashes, identical drive-state arrays, and identical policy internal state over 1000 steps x 20 agents (passes). It also shows that skipping a drive step (a broken fast path) diverges the world state.

### 4. Bench (done)

`python -m simlab.cli bench --agents 20 --steps 1000` now prints both numbers:
- world_only_steps_per_second=5817.9
- full_pipeline_steps_per_second=829.6

### 5. Food regrowth (done)

Each FoodPatch now carries `max_amount` and regrows by `food.regrow_rate` units/step up to it. Added `regrow_rate=0.0` to TOML (default unchanged behavior), included in the state hash (snapshot metadata), and covered by `tests/test_food_regrowth.py` (determinism, cap, hash participation, snapshot/restore preservation). Scenario dock: the old "Food regrowth" slider actually controlled initial patch density (`spawn_rate`); I relabeled it "Food density (initial patches)" and added a real "Food regrowth" slider wired to `regrow_rate`. Added the "Harsh (original)" preset that loads `configs/harsh_original.toml`.

### 6. World sweep (report only)

`scripts/world_sweep_regrowth.py`, 5 agents, 5 seeds (reduced from 10 to stay under the runtime budget), cap 10000, detection radius in {12,16,30}, regrow_rate in {0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05}. Ran in 481.6s.

Break-even arithmetic (5 moving agents): drain 0.0336/step/agent, total 0.168/step; energy per food unit 1.0 (1:1 transfer); 20 initial patches; supply-equals-drain regrow_rate = 0.168/20 = 0.00840 units/step/patch.

Conclusion: sensors alone (random) never reach the cap and mostly die to hazards; the heuristic's survival scales strongly with regrow_rate. Agents do compete for food (shared finite patches; food is the limiting resource). Recommended parameter sets:
- detection_radius=16, regrow_rate=0.02: heuristic median hits the 10000 cap, 52% of agents reach it, starvation split reduced to 12/25.
- detection_radius=30, regrow_rate=0.02 (or 0.05): highest cap rate (60%).

Defaults unchanged; no `default.toml` modification.

### Verified
- Full suite: `40 passed` (was 34 before this work). Ruff clean.
- Bench numbers above; sweep table above.

### Open
- Awaiting your choice on adopting a recommended parameter set (detection radius / regrow rate) into a config or named preset.
- Random policy and oracle/sensor comparisons are report-only; no default changes made.
- Whether to keep `scripts/world_sweep_regrowth.py` as a long-term tool.

## Balanced preset and baseline verification

### Death-cause classifier (verified and fixed)
Old classifier labeled a death "hazard" unless energy hit zero at the exact death step, so a random walker that starved while wandering into a hazard field was mislabeled. New classifier in `scripts/episode_lib.py` measures cumulative health loss by source (hazard contact damage vs the 0.5/step starvation drain) and assigns the cause to whichever actually consumed health; survivors at the cap are truncation. Verified on random policy, 5 agents, 10 seeds:

```text
random total agents=50 median_survival=3546 starvation/hazard/truncation=5/45/0
```

Random walkers eat nothing (food_eaten=0, food_left=400). Their energy budget (mean thrust 0.5 -> speed 4 -> drain 0.024/step) empties around step 4000-4200; health then drains 0.5/step, so pure starvers die ~step 4300. Many instead die earlier inside hazard fields (energy still positive, hazard_loss ~100), which is why a naive "hazard" label was common and the median ends up ~3546 rather than near 4300.

### Oracle baseline (verified and aligned)
OracleHeuristicPolicy now mirrors the sensor HeuristicPolicy control law exactly: it filters depleted patches (amount <= 0) and uses the same turn/0.8 thrust/eat-within-1.5 mapping, sourced from world geometry instead of rays. Neither policy has flee logic (both only seek food and otherwise wander), so they are behaviorally equivalent modulo how they sense food. Medians are per agent (pooled across agents x seeds). Re-run on default config, 10 seeds, 5 agents, cap 10000:

```text
heuristic           median_survival=5808 starve/hazard/trunc=40/10/0
oracle_heuristic   median_survival=3188 starve/hazard/trunc=41/9/0
random             median_survival=3546 starve/hazard/trunc=5/45/0
```

Sensor beats oracle because the ray-sampled sensor spends much of its time in low-thrust wander (0.5, drain 0.024) rather than constant full-speed pursuit (0.8, drain 0.0336), and its quantized turning disperses agents so they exploit far more of the map; it converts far more of the 400 food units into survival time before energy runs out. (Earlier reported 6421/4100 came from the old classifier; ordering is unchanged.)

### Depleted-patch sensor fix
Observations now exclude food patches with amount <= 0, so ray-based policies cannot chase empty patches (this closes the original starvation anomaly for the registered sensor heuristic, not just `_default_action`). Oracle applies the same filter in `select_action`.

### Balanced preset (added)
- `configs/balanced.toml`: default config with `hazard.detection_radius = 16` and `food.regrow_rate = 0.02`. `configs/harsh_original.toml` unchanged.
- Scenario dock: added a "Balanced" preset (sets the sliders and detection radius).
- `tests/test_balanced.py`: qualifies preset loads (radius 16, regrow 0.02), determinism (two identical seeds -> equal state hash over 2000 steps), and regrowth is active and capped.

### Balanced evaluation (decision gate)
`scripts/balanced_eval.py`, config balanced.toml, cap 10000. Seeds reduced 20->15 to stay under the 15-minute budget (858s estimated; 793.6s actual). Break-even regrow rates (full-speed pursuit drain 0.0336/agent/step, 20 patches): 1 agent = 0.00168, 5 agents = 0.00840, 20 agents = 0.03360.

```text
policy agents median_survival cap_pct mean_food_left starve/hazard/trunc
heuristic          1  10000 73.3 394.0  2/2/11
heuristic          5   6906 41.3 383.2 40/4/31
heuristic         20   6766 37.0 206.6 185/4/111

oracle_heuristic   5   3199 22.7 388.9 38/20/17
oracle_heuristic  20   3186 10.3 338.0 176/93/31
random              1   1886  0.0 400.0  0/15/0
random              5   3229  0.0 400.0  8/67/0
random             20   4262  0.0 400.0 141/159/0
```

Decision rule: at 5 agents sensor reaches cap 41.3% (in 40-70), random 0% (<10), but starvation is 40/44 = 90.9% of heuristic non-truncation deaths (>5%). Rule fails, so `configs/default.toml` was NOT changed.

1-agent vs 20-agent: a single agent reaches the cap most often (73%) but leaves ~394 food because it cannot cover the map; 20 agents consume far more (food_left 207) but cap drops to 37% from competition/clustering thinning patches faster. Regrowth should scale with agent count: the break-even rate is linear in agent count (0.0017 / 0.0084 / 0.0336), so one fixed rate cannot be optimal for all counts; the current 0.02 covers 5 agents but is above 1-agent need and below 20-agent need. Recommend making regrow_rate a per-scenario value and/or scaling it with agent count, plus better foraging/hazard avoidance to cut the dominant starvation mode.

### Verified
Full suite `44 passed`, ruff clean.

## Foraging diagnosis and heuristic v2

### Step 1 + 4 — starvation root cause and foraging fix
Diagnosis (`scripts/foraging_diag.py`, Balanced, 5 agents, 10 seeds, `heuristic_noflee`): starved agents spent ~99.4% of steps in `seek` mode with only ~14-20 eat ticks total, and never reached eat range — the nearest-food-ray distance was pinned at ~2.86-2.88 (just above the 1.5 threshold) while the agent orbited the patch. The defect is a convergence/orbit problem, not out-of-range eating.

Fix in `HeuristicPolicyNoflee`/`OracleHeuristicPolicyNoflee`: a near-food branch (within 5.0 units) that reduces thrust to 0.5 and steers harder (turn gain /60) so the agent converges instead of orbiting. After the fix, starved agents eat properly (eat ticks ~1900-2700, food ~55-240 units, eat-mode ~30-34%); starvation dropped from 22/30 (pinned) to 4/50 noflee and 3/50 with flee.

### Step 2 — sensor vs oracle reconciliation
On `heuristic_noflee` vs `oracle_noflee` (6 seeds, 5 agents), mean thrust (0.799 vs 0.800) and drain/step (0.0336) are identical, so the survival gap is not explained by thrust/drain. Sensor ate 196.2 food units/agent vs oracle 90.4 and survived median 8406 vs 3183; the oracle dies earlier to hazards and therefore converts fewer total units per agent. Oracle is not currently a meaningful upper bound.

### Step 3 — hazard flee
Added flee to both sensor (`HeuristicPolicy`, default `heuristic`) and oracle (`OracleHeuristicPolicy`, default `oracle`): flee when hazard threat > 0.3, turn away from the nearest hazard ray/bearing. Historic non-flee versions remain registered as `heuristic_noflee` and `oracle_noflee` (alias `oracle_heuristic`).

### Step 5 — scenario-level supply scaling
Added optional `food.supply_ratio`. When set, `Runner` computes `regrow_rate = supply_ratio * n_agents * 0.0336 / n_patches` (0.0336 = nominal drain per agent at thrust 0.8). Raw `regrow_rate` stays available (slider now labeled "Food regrowth (raw)"). `configs/balanced.toml` now uses `supply_ratio = 2.0` (+ radius 16). Tests: rate scales with agent count, determinism holds, snapshot/restore preserves the effective rate.

### Step 6 — Balanced re-evaluation (decision gate)
`scripts/balanced_eval_v2.py`, multiprocessing (one process per seed, stdlib). Verified `mp == serial` on 2 seeds. Grid: 15 seeds, cap 10000, agents {1,5,20}, policies {heuristic, heuristic_noflee, oracle, random}:

```text

```

Final 20-seed run, 5 agents: heuristic cap 69.0%, median 10000, split (4,27,69), food_left 363.6, starved_with_food 4; random cap 0%, median 3242, split (10,90,0).

Revised decision rule: sensor cap 40-70% at all counts, random <10%, <10% of heuristic deaths starved with >=50% food uneaten, heuristic hazard deaths non-zero and <40% of deaths. Result: NOT met. Sensor cap is 20% at 1 agent (too low) and 74.7-85.3% at 5/20 agents (above 70); the deaths that occur are dominated by hazard contact (79-100% of heuristic deaths). Random is 0% everywhere. `configs/default.toml` was NOT changed. Regrowth already scales with agent count via `supply_ratio`; at 5/20 agents supply exceeds drain so agents reach the cap, while at 1 agent the lone agent cannot cover the map and dies to hazards.

## Round 4 - "World v1 baseline"

### Step 1 - decision rule and default copy
New per-agent rule applied to the 5-agent reference only, 20 seeds, cap 10000
(`scripts/rule_check_5agent.py`): heuristic cap 69.0% (PASS 40-75), random cap
0.0% (PASS <10), starved-with->=50%-food-uneaten 4% (PASS <10), heuristic hazard
deaths 27% (PASS 5-50). All criteria passed, so balanced settings were copied into
`configs/default.toml` (hazard detection_radius 16, food supply_ratio 2.0, raw
regrow_rate 0.0). `configs/balanced.toml` and `configs/harsh_original.toml` kept.

### Snapshot/restore regression (fixed)
Copying the defaults enabled nonzero regrowth, which exposed a genuine ordering
bug in `World.step`: the snapshot was captured **before** `_regrow_food`, so a
snapshot at step N omitted step N's regrowth while `state_hash()` (computed
after the step) included it. Restoring such a checkpoint systematically dropped
that regrowth tick, so `test_scrub_back_500_steps_and_replay...` failed for any
nonzero regrowth rate. Fixed by running `_regrow_food` before snapshot capture,
making the snapshot reflect the full post-step state consistent with
`state_hash()`. This was a code fix, not a stale-default test change; no test
needed updating. Full suite: 47 passed; ruff clean.

### Step 2 - hazard scaling diagnosis (no config change)
`scripts/hazard_sweep.py`, 15 seeds, cap 10000. Confirmed the chase rule: each
hazard independently targets the nearest alive agent within its
detection_radius (`World._move_hazards`).

```

The data support the hypothesis: at 1 agent each hazard chases the single agent,
so increasing hazard count monotonically lowers the cap (33 -> 27 -> 20%) and
raises hazard deaths. Proposed (not implemented): optional `hazard.per_agent`
(unset by default) analogous to `food.supply_ratio` so hazard pressure scales
with agent count.

### Step 3 - docs/BASELINES.md
Written: reference scenario, results table (random / heuristic_noflee /
heuristic / oracle at 1/5/20 agents), reproduce command per row, commit hash
(`world-v1`), oracle policies marked "not an upper bound; kept for reference
only", and which policies need observations.

## Round 5 - "Solo scenario diagnosis and baseline"

### Step 1 - snapshot ordering fix verification (no dynamics change)
Re-ran the 20-seed 5-agent page row (`scripts/rule_check_5agent.py`): identical
to the pre-fix baseline (heuristic 69.0/10000/(4,27,69)/363.6/4; random
0.0/3242/(10,90,0)), proving moving `_regrow_food` before snapshot capture
changed the RNG draws, food amounts seen by policies/sensors, or state hashes -
only what the snapshot records. Added
`test_restore_with_regrowth_matches_at_multiple_scrub_points`
(`tests/test_phase5.py`): 2 agents, seed 71, eat every 7 steps, total 800, scrub
points (100, 300, 550), replay 200 steps. Verified it fails with the bug
reverted and passes with the fix.

### Step 2 - solo starvation diagnosis and fix
`scripts/foraging_diag.py` (1 agent, 1 hazard, supply_ratio 2.0, radius 16,
20 seeds, sensor heuristic with flee): 7/20 starved. Traces showed agents
orbiting a target at ray distance ~1.45-1.67 with patch amount stuck at 20.0
(eat never connecting), ~36% eat / 64% seek mode, food-ray hit fraction ~1.0.

Root cause: the eat branch in `HeuristicPolicyNoflee._act` used thrust 0.6
(v = 4.8, min turn radius r_min = v/omega_max = 4.8/3.0 = 1.6 > 1.5 eat range),
so the agent could physically never get inside the true eat radius and eat never
connected. Fix: eat branch uses thrust 0.4 and steer gain 60 (r_min = 1.067 <
1.5). After fix: starved 7/20 -> 0/20 (0 starvation, 8 hazard, 12 truncation,
per `scripts/solo_eval.py`; an earlier prose note of "13 truncation / 7 hazard"
was a miscount and is corrected here). Rule check still passes (heuristic cap
75.0% at the [40,75] edge, random cap 0%, starved-with-food 0%, hazard deaths
25%): ALL PASS.

### Step 3 - Solo preset and evaluation
Added `configs/solo.toml` (1 agent, 1 hazard, else balanced/default values) and a
"Solo" preset in the Scenario dock (`simlab/gui/scenario.py`) that loads it
(including the agent-count slider). `scripts/solo_eval.py`, 20 seeds, cap
10000:

```text
heuristic          cap= 60.0%  median=10000  split=(0,8,12)  food_left(mean)=379.9
heuristic_noflee   cap= 25.0%  median=1245  split=(0,15,5)  food_left(mean)=379.8
random             cap=  0.0%  median=4198  split=(4,16,0)  food_left(mean)=400.0
```

Solo row added to `docs/BASELINES.md` with reproduce command. `configs/default.toml`
unchanged.

### Step 4 - full suite and ruff
Full suite: 48 passed. Ruff: all checks passed. Committed as "Solo scenario
diagnosis and baseline", tagged `world-v1.1`.

### Still open
- 1-agent cap for heuristic with flee is 60% (a single focused hazard still
  causes 8/20 hazard deaths); hazard.per_agent deliberately not implemented per
  user decision.
- The eat-branch fix (thrust 0.4 / steer gain 60) changes heuristic world
  dynamics, raising the 5-agent cap to the upper edge (75%) of the allowed
  window - worth monitoring in future reference runs.

---

## Round 6 - Baseline refresh with CIs

Decisions: accept the 75% 5-agent cap (no retuning); do not implement
hazard.per_agent; keep the eat-branch behavior but make it principled.

### Step 1 - reproducibility names
Registered pre-fix sensor/oracle heuristics as `heuristic_v2` / `oracle_v2`
in `simlab/builtin/policies.py`. `heuristic_v2` reproduces the world-v1-era
sensor heuristic (eat thrust 0.6, steer /135, with flee); `oracle_v2`
reproduces the world-v1 oracle. The world-v1 table is covered by the
`world-v1` tag (commit `4c105be`) and by `heuristic_v2` / `oracle_v2` in the
current tree.

### Step 2 - derive instead of hardcode
Near-food thrust is now derived: `thrust = 0.7 * eat_dist * max_turn_rate /
speed_factor` = 0.7 * 1.5 * 3.0 / 8.0 = 0.39375, used for all near-food
branches (eat and close) of `heuristic` and `oracle`, reading the constants
from config (`agent.max_turn_rate`, `agent.speed_factor`, `food.eat_dist`).
Added `tests/test_heuristic_turn_radius.py`: for every principled heuristic
min_turn_radius < eat_range, and it fails if thrust is reverted to 0.6
(min radius 1.6 > 1.5). 5-agent Balanced cap before/after (20 seeds, rule
check script): heuristic 75.0% -> 80.0% (hazard share 25% -> 20%). `heuristic_v2`
reproduces the old 69.0% final-20-seed run exactly.

### Step 3 - baseline refresh with CIs
Rewrote `docs/BASELINES.md` with a 20-seed grid for {1, 5, 20} agents + Solo
x {random, heuristic_noflee, heuristic, heuristic_v2}, 95% bootstrap CIs over
seeds, median survival, death-cause split, mean food left, per-row commit hash
and reproduce command. Grid produced by `scripts/baseline_refresh.py`
(multiprocessing, one process per episode).

Balanced 5 (cap% / CI / median / split / food_left):
- random: 0.0% [0,0] / 3242 / (10,90,0) / 400.0
- heuristic_noflee: 4.0% [1,8] / 1201 / (0,96,4) / 390.8
- heuristic: 80.0% [71,88] / 10000 / (0,20,80) / 372.5
- heuristic_v2: 69.0% [55,82] / 10000 / (4,27,69) / 363.6

Solo (cap% / CI / median / split / food_left):
- random: 0.0% [0,0] / 4198 / (4,16,0) / 400.0
- heuristic_noflee: 25.0% [10,45] / 1240 / (0,15,5) / 376.8
- heuristic: 50.0% [30,70] / 10000 / (0,10,10) / 380.0
- heuristic_v2: 35.0% [15,55] / 6417 / (7,6,7) / 384.3

### Step 4 - reconcile solo numbers
The solo heuristic split is canonically 0 starvation / 8 hazard / 12 truncation
(`scripts/solo_eval.py`, seeds 0..19). The "13 truncation / 7 hazard" that
appeared in the round-5 prose was a miscount; the raw diag hazard-seed set
{0,1,5,7,10,17,18,19} = 8 hazard matches the eval. PROGRESS.md round-5 prose
corrected.

### Step 5 - how-to-compare section
Added to `docs/BASELINES.md` header: scenario rows to run, seed list
(range(20)), metrics (cap% with CI, median survival, death-cause split), and
the rule that a learned policy counts as better only if its CI does not overlap
the heuristic's CI on the same cell.

### Step 6 - full suite and ruff
Full suite: 51 passed. Ruff: all checks passed. Committed as "Baseline refresh
with CIs", tagged `world-v1.2`.

### Still open
- Derived thrust moves the 5-agent heuristic cap to 80.0% (CI [71,88]),
  above the earlier accepted 75% edge; accepted per this round's decision, but
  worth monitoring. The `heuristic_v2` frozen row remains at 69.0%.
- Oracle policies remain "not an upper bound"; only reference.
- `debug_test4.py` remains untracked scratch (not committed).

## Round 7 - Eval CLI and Hard scenario

Decisions: accept the 80% Balanced-5 heuristic cap; keep oracle policies
registered and marked "not an upper bound"; delete `_baseline_refresh_out.txt`
and add `_*.txt` to `.gitignore`.

### Step 1 - Hard preset
Supply_ratio sweep at 5 agents, 20 seeds, cap 10000 (`scripts/hard_sweep.py`):
heuristic cap was 80.0% (CI [71,88]) at every ratio in {0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5}
with zero starvation (cap is hazard-bound, not food-bound). Leftover food
declined with ratio. Selected `supply_ratio = 0.8` (least surplus food, still
no starvation) and saved `configs/hard.toml` + a "Hard" preset in the Scenario
dock (`simlab/gui/scenario.py`). `configs/default.toml` unchanged. Hard rows
added to `docs/BASELINES.md`.

### Step 2 - machine-readable baselines
`scripts/baseline_refresh.py` now also writes `docs/baselines.json` covering
balanced_1/5/20, solo, and hard_1/5/20 x {random, heuristic_noflee,
heuristic, heuristic_v2}: cap%, CI bounds, median, death-cause counts, food
left, seeds, cap, git commit, and UTC date.

### Step 3 - eval CLI
Added `python -m simlab.cli eval --policy NAME [--drive NAME] --scenario
{balanced,solo,hard} --agents N --seeds 20 --cap 10000 --workers 4 --out
results/NAME.json --compare` in `simlab/cli.py` + `simlab/eval_lib.py` (full
pipeline, multiprocessing one process per seed, bootstrap CI over seeds,
death cause split, food eaten/agent, hazard contacts per 1000 steps, mean
energy, wall time). `--compare` reads `docs/baselines.json` and prints
BETTER/WORSE/NOT DISTINGUISHABLE vs random, heuristic_noflee, heuristic.
Determinism: two runs of heuristic on balanced_5 produced the identical output
hash `dbd7610d51fc57da` (wall_time excluded from the canonical hash).

Eval CLI (heuristic, balanced_5, 20 seeds): cap 80.0% CI [71,88], median
10000, split (0 starve / 20 hazard / 80 trunc), food_eaten/agent 226.49,
hazard_contacts/1000 12.387, mean_energy 98.83, food_left 372.5, wall ~41.6s.

### Step 4 - reference learned-policy plugin
Added `simlab/plugins/example_learned_policy.py` (registered `example_learned`):
numpy-only GRU-like recurrent cell with fixed random weights, uses obs and
drive_state, `needs_observations = True`, `reset(n_agents, rng)`,
`get_state()`/`set_state()`, no torch. Documented as the template in
`docs/EXTENDING.md`. Added `tests/test_example_learned_policy.py` (positive and
negative scrub-back replay tests).

### Step 5 - full suite and ruff
Full suite: 53 passed (19.8s). Ruff: all checks passed. Committed as "Eval CLI
and Hard scenario", tagged `world-v1.3`.

### Still open
- The Hard preset cannot be made substantially harder by supply_ratio alone:
  the 5-agent heuristic cap stays at 80% (hazard-bound). A harder benchmark
  would need a different hazard regime, not food scaling.
- `docs/examples/heuristic_balanced_5.json` is a committed eval artifact; other
  `results/*.json` scratch files were deleted. `results/` is not gitignored.
- Baselines in `docs/baselines.json` are generated at commit time and cite the
  tag `world-v1.3`; a later commit would need a refresh to update the hash.

## Round 8 - Hazard-based Hard scenario (world-v1.4)

Decisions: harder benchmark through hazards (not food); gitignore results/;
self-validating baselines.

### Step 1 - identical 20 hazard deaths diagnosed
`scripts/hazard_death_diag.py` (Balanced 5-agent, 20 seeds): the same seed set
dies by hazard at every supply_ratio (0.8/1.0/1.2/1.5). Deaths are bimodal
(11/20 before step 3000, 9/20 after), every hazard-death agent has very high
contact counts (250-1001) and 50-100% flee fraction in the final 200 steps.
Conclusion: NOT mostly-early spawn luck; sustained hazard chase / flee failure.
Because the gate was "add safe-spawn only if deaths are mostly early", the
spawn_clearance rule was intentionally NOT implemented.

### Step 2 - hazard-based Hard preset
`scripts/hazard_hard_sweep.py` (5 agents, supply_ratio 2.0, 20 seeds, cap
10000, heuristic + random): hazard count 4->80%, 6->68%, 8->67%, 12->46%
[32,60], 16->41%; random 0% always. Picked hazard count 12 (closest to 50%
within the 35-65% band). Rewrote `configs/hard.toml` as count=12,
supply_ratio=2.0, detection_radius=16, regrow_rate=0.0. The "Hard" preset
(file-based) re-points automatically. Removed the old supply_ratio=0.8 hard.

### Step 3 - self-validating baselines
`simlab/eval_lib.py`: added `resolved_config_hash(config_path, agents)` and
`policy_source_hash(policy_name)` (SHA256 first 16 hex); `compare_to_baselines`
now returns {"stale": [...], "verdicts": [...]} and refuses verdicts when stale
unless allow_stale. `scripts/baseline_refresh.py` stores config_hash per
scenario and policy_hash per policy in docs/baselines.json. `simlab/cli.py`
eval gained `--allow-stale` and prints STALE + refusal. Added
tests/test_baseline_selfval.py (4 tests). CLI demonstration: changing
detection_radius to 17 made balanced_5 stale and verdicts refused; --allow-stale
bypassed (verdicts BETTER/BETTER/NOT DISTINGUISHABLE). Config restored after.

### Step 4 - gitignore and example move
Added `results/` to .gitignore. `git mv results/heuristic_balanced_5.json` ->
docs/examples/heuristic_balanced_5.json (mkdir docs/examples first). PROGRESS.md
reference updated.

### Step 5 - baseline regeneration, suite, ruff
`scripts/baseline_refresh.py` regenerated docs/baselines.json + printed tables
(now with config_hash/policy_hash). Hard 5: heuristic cap 46% [32,60] median
9110, random 0%. docs/BASELINES.md Hard section updated to the hazard-based
preset. Eval CLI determinism re-verified: two balanced_5 runs -> identical hash
1c6ac660695fa7d7. Full suite: 59 passed (20.45s). Ruff: all checks passed.
Committed as "Hazard-based Hard scenario", tagged `world-v1.4`.

## Round 9 - Achievability check (`world-v1.5`)

### Step 1 - escape physics
`scripts/escape_physics.py` (new): hazard speed 2.0 units/s (=0.2 units/step,
heading snaps to nearest live agent inside detection radius); agent max speed at
thrust 1.0 = 8.0 units/s; sensor-heuristic flee thrust 0.8 -> 6.4 units/s;
agent max turn rate 3.0 rad/s; derived near-food thrust 0.3937; contact damage
0.1 health/step (1000 steps to kill from full health). Straight-line agent/hazard
ratio 4x, so a chase CAN be outrun. Traces for the first 5 Hard hazard-death
agents: each is pinned at a wall/corner (position forced to (0,0) or (0,50)),
the hazard parks on top (distance -> 0), and the flee branch keeps pushing into
the boundary -> wall/corner trapping is the binding limit, not raw speed.

### Step 2 - `oracle_avoid` upper-bound probe
`simlab/builtin/policies.py` `OracleHeuristicAvoid` (124 lines, registered
`"oracle_avoid"`, world-state, needs_observations=False). Forages to food not
within a hazard's detection radius when possible; flees at thrust 1.0 away from
the vector sum of all hazard positions (tangential near walls, pushes out of
corners); never idles in a hazard's detection radius. Smoke-tested (1000-step
run). Documented in docs/BASELINES.md as an upper-bound probe, not a baseline.

### Step 3 - evaluation and verdict
`scripts/baseline_refresh.py` grid extended with `oracle_avoid`; docs/baselines.json
regenerated (config + policy hashes). Eval CLI `--compare`, 20 seeds, cap 10000:
Hard 5 oracle_avoid cap 74% [63,85] vs heuristic 46% [32,60] -> **BETTER**,
headroom exists, Hard is winnable. Balanced 5 oracle_avoid 54% vs heuristic 80%
-> WORSE (heuristic already saturates; avoidance adds starvation). Determinism:
rerun identical hash 7fdec01770fce33b.

### Step 4 - suite, ruff, docs
Full suite 59 passed; ruff clean; PROGRESS.md and docs/BASELINES.md updated.
Committed as "Achievability check", tagged `world-v1.5`.

### Still open
- Safe-spawn (spawn_clearance) not implemented - gate not met (deaths not
  mostly early).
- Hazard-death agents show sustained chase / flee failure (contact counts
  250-1001, 50-100% flee fraction). Flee instinct never overtakes pursuit.
- The "Hard" preset is hazard-bound (12 hazards); food supply scaling is at
  supply_ratio 2.0.

## Round 10 - Reference policy and seed protocol (world-v1.6)

### Step 1 - diagnose oracle_avoid starvation
diag_oracle_starve.py (grid) and diag_oracle_focus.py (single-seed trace)
identified crumb-camping: the oracle targeted a patch whose remaining amount
equalled the per-step regrowth (0.0168), draining it while paying a larger
movement cost; energy slowly eroded. This explained 46%/24% starvation on
Balanced/Hard 5 with ~360 of 400 food units uneaten.

### Step 2 - fix oracle_avoid (iteration 1, final)
_select_food now skips patches with remaining amount <= AMOUNT_EPSILON=0.5
when a fuller patch exists, else picks the largest remaining amount. Dev seeds
0-19: Balanced 5 cap 98% [95,100] (starve=2/hazard=0/trunc=98); Hard 5 cap
96% [91,100] (starve=0/hazard=4/trunc=96). Target met after iteration 1
(Balanced NOT WORSE; Hard BETTER with starvation <10%).

### Step 3 - seed protocol
Added --seed-offset to eval CLI and baseline_refresh.py. Dev seeds 0-19; test
seeds 1000-1019. docs/baselines.json regenerated with seed_sets.dev and
seed_sets.test (config + policy hashes). oracle_avoid test seeds: Balanced 5
cap 99% [97,100] BETTER; Hard 5 cap 93% [87,98] BETTER - verdicts match dev.

### Step 4 - known limitation
Recorded in docs/BASELINES.md: the heuristic loses agents pinned at walls/corners
while fleeing though 4x faster than hazards; headroom for learned policies is
wall/corner escape.

### Step 5 - docs/LEARNER_API.md
Written: obs layout (rays/ray_types/proprioception/agent_position), Action
fields, drive_state order, reset/step signatures, get_state/set_state snapshot
hooks, episode lifecycle, throughput (1 agent 3279.8 steps/s, 5 agents 1200.1
steps/s single-process), torch policy allowance, eval/compare commands on dev
and test seeds.

### Step 6 - suite, ruff, commit, tag
Full suite 59 passed; ruff clean. Committed as "Reference policy and seed
protocol", tagged world-v1.6.

## Round 11 - Learner harness and PPO smoke test (learner-v0)

### Step 1 - throughput (workers 1/2/4/8, Balanced 5, 20 seeds, cap 10000)
Baseline steps/s (aggregate world steps over all workers): 1w=972.7,
2w=1979.6, 4w=3725.3, 8w=5384.9. With OMP/MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 in worker
processes: 1w=1343.0, 2w=2500.0, 4w=4255.3, 8w=6670.2. 4w threads=1 is
3.17x single-process (target >=2.5x met). agg_hash identical across runs.
BLAS oversubscription confirmed (single-process +38% with threads=1).

### Step 2 - housekeeping
docs/baselines.json now records git_describe (world-v1.6) at generation time
instead of a bare commit hash; eval --compare relies on config/policy hashes
only. No STALE warning appears when config and policy hashes match.

### Step 3 - torch isolation
torch 2.14.1+cpu installed via optional [learn] extra. torch.cuda.is_available()
= False (no GPU). Test confirms importing simlab.core and simlab.cli (without
train) does not load torch. Torch imported only lazily inside plugin/training
modules.

### Step 4 - reward and observation encoding
Added registered task survival_shaped (+0.01 alive, -1.0 on death,
+0.05*delta energy fraction on positive gain); SurvivalTask unchanged. Learner
encoding: 16 rays x (distance/20 + one-hot of 4 ray types) + energy/100,
health/100, speed/max_speed = 83 dims obs_only; Option B appends 8 drives = 91.

### Step 5 - learned_gru plugin
simlab/plugins/learned_gru.py: GRU hidden 64 + actor/critic, parameter-shared,
needs_observations=True, per-agent hidden reset/get_state/set_state (get_state
returns a copy, fixing a zero-copy alias bug), loads from --checkpoint, and
folds checkpoint hash into policy_hash. Tests pass: scrub-back replay identical
actions, breaks-if-not-restored, torch isolation, eval determinism.

### Step 6 - recurrent PPO trainer
simlab/training/ppo.py + train subcommand: GAE (gamma .995, lambda .95),
clip .2, Adam LR decay 3e-4, entropy, sequence minibatches len 32 with episode
masks. Rollout workers each own a World and a CPU copy of the policy
(torch.set_num_threads(1)). Training seeds from 100000 up. Tiny smoke (3000
steps) passed.

### Step 7 - 300k smoke test (obs_only, 4 workers, Balanced 5)
Wall ~9.8 min; throughput ~509 env steps/s aggregate (~2546 agent steps/s).
Learning curve: mean return 0.13 -> ~2.00, entropy 3.53 -> 4.01 (exploring),
approx_kl small, value loss decreasing. Quick-eval (dev seeds 0-4, cap 2000)
mostly 100% cap (one 96% dip at it=159).
Final checkpoint on dev seeds 0-19, cap 10000, 4 workers:
- Balanced 5: cap 5.0% [2,9], median 3705, starve 94/hazard 1/trunc 5,
  food_left 390.3, mean_energy 51.95. Verdicts: random BETTER, heuristic_noflee
  NOT DISTINGUISHABLE, heuristic WORSE.
- Hard 5: cap 11.0% [6,16], median 3913, starve 76/hazard 13/trunc 11,
  food_left 385.5. Verdicts: random BETTER, heuristic_noflee BETTER, heuristic WORSE.
The learner beats random clearly but sits below the hand-crafted heuristic on
both scenarios. Learning curve is not flat/diverging, but the policy does not
yet match the heuristic; the cap is limited by late starvation (survival median
~3700-3900 vs cap 10000).

### Step 8 - docs/EXPERIMENTS.md
Planned obs_only vs obs_drives experiment (3 training seeds each), exact
commands, estimated wall time (~45-60 min with two jobs at a time), and eval
protocol (cap CI, median survival, death-cause split on test seeds 1000-1019,
pairwise condition comparison).

### Step 9 - suite, ruff, commit, tag
Full suite 63 passed; ruff clean. Committed as "Learner harness and PPO smoke
test", tagged learner-v0.

## Phase 7 — architecture-agnostic learner

Status: architecture plumbing complete; committed as `arch-v0`.

- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURES.md` (design note) describing the two-slot model:
  world-facing numpy DriveCore (`none`/`constant`/`rda8`) and learner-side torch
  Backbone (`gru`/`transformer`/`rda` stub), joined by a TorchPolicy adapter
  behind the existing `Policy` port.
- `simlab/training/backbones.py`: Backbone ABC + GRU (exact legacy reproduction),
  causal Transformer (ring-buffer state), rda stub, and `match_params` (picks a
  hidden/d_model size within 5% of a target parameter count).
- `simlab/training/torch_policy.py`: `TorchPolicy` adapter + `make_policy(cfg)`
  (keys `backbone`, `drive_core`, `fusion`, `kwargs`, `obs_mode`, `match_params`,
  `checkpoint`), registered as policy `learned_torch`. Legacy learner-v0
  checkpoints load automatically (no `arch` key -> GRU, obs mode inferred).
- `simlab/plugins/drive_cores.py`: numpy drive cores `none`, `constant`, `rda8`
  (EMA with scalar or per-drive decay) with `get_state()/set_state()` for replay.
- `simlab/training/ppo.py` refactored to depend only on the TorchPolicy adapter
  (trainer/eval no longer reach into the network directly).
- `simlab/cli.py` eval now prints `param_count` per config.
- Tests (`tests/test_architecture.py`): backward-compat legacy checkpoint loads
  through the new path and reproduces the exact hash `d3e1532311768f52`
  (Balanced 5, dev seeds 0-4, cap 2000); parametrized {gru, transformer} x
  {none, constant, rda8} smoke (shapes, done_mask reset, 2-iteration PPO);
  rda8 causality; rda8 snapshot/replay bit-identical round-trip; match_params
  within 5%.
- `eval --compare` on existing baselines shows no STALE warnings; world/scenario/
  GUI/heuristic-oracle files untouched.

Raw verification output:

```text
74 passed in 49.21s
All checks passed!
backward_compat hash=d3e1532311768f52 cap_pct=100.0%
```

## Phase 8 â€” Architecture GUI panel

Status: panel complete; committed as `gui-arch-v0`.

- `simlab/training/arch_spec.py` (torch-free): `ArchSpec` metadata, registry
  (`register_arch`/`add_spec`), dataclass field schema (min/max/choices/help),
  `validate_config`/`normalize_config` from the spec alone, `arch_hash`,
  `build_policy_cfg`, TOML save/load, `scan_plugin_dir` (errors collected, never
  raised) and `write_template`. Built-in backbone specs (gru/transformer/rda)
  with lazy loaders; drive-core specs registered beside their classes in
  `simlab/plugins/drive_cores.py`.
- `simlab/gui/architecture.py`: **ArchitectureWidget** â€” backbone/drive-core/
  fusion/obs-mode dropdowns, a form auto-generated from the selected spec's
  fields (spinboxes/combos/checkboxes), Rescan, plugin error list, New-template
  button, Build (torch loads lazily in a BuilderThread; shows param count and
  architecture hash), Apply-to-world, checkpoint playback, and save/load
  experiment TOML under `runs/`. `_ProcessLauncher` streams CLI train/eval via
  QProcess with a Stop button. The panel never names a specific architecture.
- `simlab/gui/main_window.py`: new Architecture dock; `_apply_arch` drives the
  existing world view with the built policy/checkpoint.
- `simlab/core/config.py`: `drive_config` and `policy_cfg` runtime-injected
  (never serialized) fields; `worker_components.py` passes them through.
- `simlab/training/ppo.py`: `PPOConfig.arch`; `_build_net` builds from the arch
  selection and falls back to the legacy GRU path; `_WorkerEnv` wires the drive
  core from the arch. `simlab/cli.py`: `train --arch <toml>`.
- Tests (`tests/test_gui_architecture.py`, offscreen): no-torch import
  subprocess (sentinel `TORCH_PRESENT=False`), a form per registered spec,

## Phase 9 � PPO training profile (perf-v0)

Status: profiling complete; option changes committed as `perf-v0`. GPU step
skipped (CPU-only torch installed).

- `simlab/training/ppo.py`: `PPOConfig.profile` (default False). When set, the
  trainer records wall-clock shares per phase (broadcast, IPC/collect wait,
  GAE, PPO update, lr schedule, other) and a worker-side split (env stepping /
  policy inference / bookkeeping), printed at the end. Default path unchanged.
- `simlab/cli.py`: `train --profile` flag (off by default).
- No CUDA torch installed (`torch 2.14.1+cpu`, build cuda None); GPU is an
  RTX 5060 Ti (Blackwell, compute 12.0), so the GPU-update step (STEP 4) was
  not run and no `--update-device` option was added. No wheels installed.

Measurements (obs_only, Balanced 5, seed 100000, 18432 env steps):

```text
workers   wall(s)   env steps/s   PPO update%   IPC/collect%   GAE%
4         18.42     1000.6        58.2          39.7           0.3
6         17.85     1032.4        63.1          34.5           0.3
8         18.17     1014.3        63.5          33.8           0.3
```
Worker split (4w): env stepping 40.7%, policy inference 40.8%, bookkeeping
18.6%. The PPO torch update dominates wall time; the learner is the bottleneck,
not rollout workers. Worker-sweep checkpoints diverge (expected: different
worker count changes iteration count and RNG stream usage).

Recommended: 6 workers; keep update on CPU (GPU split not beneficial at this
scale given update-bound profile and no CUDA torch installed).
